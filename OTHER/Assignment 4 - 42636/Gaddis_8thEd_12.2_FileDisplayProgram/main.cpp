 * File:   File Display Program
 * Author: Kenzie Vasquez
 * Created on April 3, 2017, 6:30 PM
 * Purpose: Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file. The 
   program should display the contents of the file on the screen. If the file’s 
   contents won’t fit on a single screen, the program should display 24 lines of 
   output at a time, and then pause. Each time the program pauses, it should 
   wait for the user to strike a key before the next 24 lines are displayed.
