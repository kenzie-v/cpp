/* 
 * File:   String Search
 * Author: Kenzie Vasquez
 * Created on April 4, 2017, 9:45 PM
 * Purpose: Write a program that asks the user for a file name and a string to 
   search for. The program should search the file for every occurrence of a 
   specified string. When the string is found, the line that contains it should 
   be displayed. After all the occurrences have been located, the program should 
   report the number of times the string appeared in the file.
